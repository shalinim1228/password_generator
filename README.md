This code is a password generator GUI application built using Python's Tkinter library. The program lets users specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password, generates the password randomly, and displays it on the screen. Here's a breakdown of the code and its functionality:

1. Import Libraries:
random: Used to select random characters for the password.
tkinter (tk) and messagebox: Used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) and handle any error messages.
2. Global Character Lists:
letters: Contains all lowercase and uppercase English alphabets (a-z and A-Z).
symbols: Contains various special characters like !, @, #, etc.
numbers: Contains digits from 0 to 9.
3. generate_password() Function:
This function is responsible for:

Taking the user's input (the number of letters, symbols, and numbers for the password).
Randomly generating the password by selecting the required number of characters from the letters, symbols, and numbers lists.
Shuffling the characters to ensure randomness.
Converting the list of characters into a string and displaying it on the screen.
The function also includes error handling using try-except. If the user enters non-numeric input, an error message is displayed using a messagebox.

4. Creating the Main GUI Window:
The window is created using Tk() from the Tkinter library.
The window's title is set as "Password Generator".
Padding (padx=20, pady=20) is added around the window to ensure there is some spacing inside the GUI.
5. Layout with grid:
The widgets (labels, entries, and buttons) are arranged in the window using Tkinter's grid layout manager, where:

grid(row, column) defines the position of the widget in a grid.
sticky="nsew" ensures that the widget sticks to the sides of the grid cell and expands to fill the space when resizing the window.
grid_columnconfigure is used to make the columns flexible and expand when the window is resized.
6. Widgets:
Title Label: Displays the text "Welcome to Password Generator" in bold and large font.
Labels and Entry Widgets: There are labels prompting the user to input how many letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password. These labels are aligned to the right (sticky="e"), while the entries are aligned to the left (sticky="w").
Generate Button: A button labeled "Generate Password" that triggers the generate_password() function to generate the password when clicked.
Password Output Label: Displays the generated password in a text label. Initially, this label is empty.
7. Running the Application:
Finally, the mainloop() method starts the Tkinter event loop, allowing the GUI to remain open and interactive until the user closes it.
Key Functional Features:
User Inputs: The user provides the number of letters, symbols, and numbers through the entry boxes.
Random Password Generation: The password is randomly generated based on the user's inputs.
Error Handling: If the user enters invalid inputs (non-numeric values), an error message appears.
Dynamic Resizing: The layout adjusts to window resizing, thanks to the use of the grid layout and the sticky attribute.
This application is user-friendly and gives users full control over the type of characters included in their generated password.
